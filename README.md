# SDS 192 Project 2

### Nandir Altansukh, Catherine Weeks, Natalie Lau, Lucy Watts

In this project, we analyze the top 10% of songs on Spotify that were released in 2019 using the Spotify Songs data set included in this repository. We aim to look at common traits or trends between these songs in attempt to predict what characteristics make a song popular. We explore multiple variables in the data set such including tempo, duration, valence, mode, danceability, key, energy, and loudness.

-   Our file `spotify_songs.csv` includes our original, uncleaned data set.

-   We then clean and wrangle this data in our file `data_tidying.qmd.` This then creates the file `spotify_cleaned.csv`.

-   We then explore our chosen variables in `data_analysis1.qmd`.

-   After analyzing these variables, we select a few of the most compelling and analyze them in `data_analysis2.qmd`.
